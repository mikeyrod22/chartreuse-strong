# Chartreuse Strong

This will soon be a simple password generator. This project started by cloning the starting code located in the ['friendly-parakeet' github repository.](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet)

When the button is clicked, the generator will ask the user to select their password criteria through a series of prompts. A password will then be generated in accordance with the user input and displayed on the page.
